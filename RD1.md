Objective:
I was supposed to learn how to use functions, determine what functions are useful and necessary, and how to turn a large program of code into smaller blocks of functions.

Procedure:
First, we thought of ways to divide our code into functions, and wrote our ideas out into an algorithm. Jordi wrote a good part of the algorithm, while I turned it into a flow chart. Then, we worked on test cases, and then the actual coding, We tested and double-checked everything along the way to catch any potential errors. The key concept we explored was functions, and how to split previous code into these more manageable blocks.

Results:
Our results matched what we expected to get, but only after various testing and fixing. we used various test cases for each variable used so that every one could be tested.

Reflection:
The main challenge I encountered was communication, and thinking about the project in a sense of functions instead of thinking of it as in normal coding. I was struggling with it a lot and kept getting stuck, but it took me a long time to get a hold of Jordi to ask for help, and even then he didn't explain what he did to help me understand, but just took over. I was only able to get his help after the initial deadline had already passed, and now I know I should have asked for advice at office hours, but it didn't occur to me at the time. I'm sure he was busy and had something going on in his life, but it was frustrating, and I hope I do not have the same issue in the future. We followed the first three rules of programming by making sure to think out our code before we started, coding only afterwards, and then testing frequently for every variable. This lab helped me practice thinking of coding with functions quite a bit more, and I think I achieved this goal at least, even if it was difficult.
